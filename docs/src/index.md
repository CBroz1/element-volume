# Element Volume for storing volumetric data

DataJoint Volume for volumetric data. DataJoint Elements collectively standardize and
automate data collection and analysis for neuroscience experiments. Each Element is a
modular pipeline for data storage and processing with corresponding database tables that
can be combined with other Elements to assemble a fully functional pipeline.

+ `element-volume` features a DataJoint pipeline design for lab related information.

+ `element-volume` is not a complete workflow by itself, but rather a modular design of
  tables and dependencies. 

+ `element-volume` can be flexibly attached to any DataJoint workflow.
