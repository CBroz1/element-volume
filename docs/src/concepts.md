<!-- ## Volumetric Data -->

## Key Partnerships

Over the several years, many labs have developed DataJoint-based pipelines for volumetric
data. The DataJoint team collaborated with several and interviewed these teams to
understand their experiment workflow, associated tools, and interfaces. These teams
include: 

- Applied Physics Laboratory, Johns Hopkins
